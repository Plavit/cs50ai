# Harvard University - CS50AI: Artificial Intelligence in Python
This repository contains my solutions to the CS50AI's 2020 run, as taught by Brian Yu and David J. Malan. The nominally 7 week course included practical assignments covering main approaches both in traditional deterministic AI and in more modern approaches such as deep neural networks and natural language processing.
