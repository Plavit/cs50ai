# Harvard University - CS50AI: Artificial Intelligence in Python
This repository contains my solutions to the CS50AI's 2020 run, as taught by Brian Yu and David J. Malan. The course included practical assignments covering main approaches both in traditional deterministic AI and in more modern approaches such as deep neural networks and natural language processing.
